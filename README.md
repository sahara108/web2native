Convert web app to Native apps in a minute.
all you need to do is to  change "http://www.8land.org" to your website URL, then you are ready to publish your app to the app store.

I used to charge people money for doing this. now I made it open source.
Feel free to modify it and redistribute it. 
I won't sue you unless you do something harmful to my reputation.

Good luck to your app business adventure!

and lastly, please visit my website and try out some of my apps and games.
rate if you like them. I will make more stuffs open source soon!

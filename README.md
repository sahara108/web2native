Convert web app to Native apps in a minute.
all you need to do is to  change "http://www.google.com" to your website URL, then you are ready to publish your app to the app store.

I used to charge people money for doing this. now I made it open sourced.
Feel free to modify it and redistribute it. 
I won't sue you unless you do something harmful to my reputation.

Good luck to your app business adventure!
